# odin-recipes
I am creating a website with main index page with links to recipes.
I am trying to understand the relationship between vscode, the terminal and git hub
Do I use vscode to write the code for the html pages and then open it via the terminal to send to github?
I created repo, odin-recipes via the termainal and then used "code" to get to this file on vs code.
I will add the code here, using the terminal to send commits to github as the website develops
My brain hurts, wish me luck
